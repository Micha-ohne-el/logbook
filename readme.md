# logbook

Kotlin/Multiplatform logging library.

## Installation

Simply add a dependency on logbook to your Gradle project:

```kt
repositories {
	mavenCentral()
}

// for Kotlin/Multiplatform projects:
kotlin {
	sourceSets {
		commonMain.configure {
			dependencies {
				implementation("moe.micha:logbook:$version")
			}
		}
	}
}

// for Kotlin/JVM projects:
kotlin {
	dependencies {
		implementation("moe.micha:logbook:$version")
	}
}
```

Replace `$version` with the version you want, a list of which can be retrieved on
[Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/moe.micha/logbook/versions).

## Contributing

I would love for people to contribute to logbook!

If you feel like the library is missing something or you've encountered a bug, please let me know with a
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Micha-ohne-el/logbook/issues)! No need to be shy, there is no format to these Issues,
just type whatever you want :)

If you've already got experience with Kotlin, feel free to work on a fix or feature on your own and submitting a
[Pull Request](https://github.com/Micha-ohne-el/logbook/pulls)! There are no official contribution guidelines, just try your
best and I'll see if I can fix some issues if there are any :)

## To Do

* Make `by level` use the name of the property as the level name by default.
* Make `Logbook.WithDefaults`'s random logbook color stable (i.e. use hashing instead of randomness).
* Handle multi-line log messages (such as stack traces).
* Improve timestamp formatting by using Chunks as well.
	* Extend Chunks to be able to have a min and max width, padding, alignment, etc.
* Make ci pipeline upload test results on failure too.
